# About this guide

This guide teaches the basics of manipulating data using JavaScript in the
browser, or in node.js. Specifically, these tasks are geared around preparing
data for further analysis and visualization.

This guide will demonstrate some basic techniques and how to implement them
using core JavaScript API, the [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) library and [lodash](http://lodash.com/).

It assumes you already have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

## Why?

Is data munging in JavaScript something you would actually want to do? _Maybe_.

There are other languages out there that do a great job with data wrangling:

- [R with dplyr](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/explore/README.html)
- [python with pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/fonnesbeck/5850413)
- [java (just kidding)]()

These tools are great and you should use them. Often times, however, you are already familiar with a particular language (like JavaScript) and would like to get started with data, but want to take it one step at a time.

Additionally, sometimes you are already in a particular environment (like JavaScript) and don't have the luxury of switching to one of these other options.

In these cases, JavaScript could be considered a viable option for your data analysis. And if you find yourself in one of these situations, or just want to try out JavaScript for data analysis for fun, then _this guide is for you_!

Check out some of the tasks, and see if JavaScript Data something you want to try yourself.
